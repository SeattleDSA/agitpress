# Agitpress

WIP, lightweight theme 'Agitpress', which forks work from [Susty WP](https://sustywp.com) by Jack Lenox [https://blog.jacklenox.com], under GPL v2 or later. Built to demonstrate how small a WordPress site can be: reduced code bloat, faster load times, and reduce energy waste. Uses a browser-safe font stack and has limited dependencies. Consider it a tailor-fit versus a kitchen-sink.

# Background on Susty üåç
The goals of the forked theme are outlined in a blog post entitled, [Delivering WordPress in 7KB](https://blog.jacklenox.com/2018/06/04/delivering-wordpress-in-7kb/). It is not recommended that you just go ahead and activate for your production blog or website without making some adjustments first.

# How Agitpress is different.
Agitpress eliminates dependencies on jQuery and other bloat-heavy front ends

## The Grid
Agitpress boasts a responsive grid in two flavors: mobile and desktop. Mobile is applied by default and a single media query is used on desktop machines (which can handle the small performance hit better). .grid.grid-container

The grid is broken in span 12, meaning a cell component can span from one to twelve columns. There's no complex layout adjustment. More complex layouts are possible with gutenberg blocks. Syntax is .mobile-12, .desktop-6, etc. The suffixed number is the numerator columns spanned.

## The Events Calendar Integration
Agitpress provides some rudimentary theming for The Events Calendar by applying --agitpress-accent to select elements.

## CSS Variables
The following are declared and can be overriden from the Theme Customizer:
