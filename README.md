# Agitpress

Super-lightweight theme called 'Agitpress', forking work from a project called [Susty WP](https://sustywp.com). Built to demonstrate how small a WordPress site can be, reducing code bloat, page repsonse time, and energy waste. Browser safe font-stack, limited dependencies.


# Background on Susty üåç
The goals of the forked theme are outlined in a blog post entitled, [Delivering WordPress in 7KB](https://blog.jacklenox.com/2018/06/04/delivering-wordpress-in-7kb/). It is not recommended that you just go ahead and activate for your production blog or website without making some adjustments first.
